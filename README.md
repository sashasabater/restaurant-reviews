# Restaurant Ratings Through Text Classification
Using Natural Language Processing to classifiy restaurant ratings 

## The Big Idea 
If restaurant ratings can be accurately classified by text, then businesses would be able to gain a deep understanding of the customer experience, or more specifically, what customers want out of their experience. A simple star rating from 1-5 is helpful, however it only goes so far--we do not know what the customer liked or didn't like. With a system that can classify ratings through text, a business owner can collect information about, say, which words or sentiments their business is trying to illicit.
